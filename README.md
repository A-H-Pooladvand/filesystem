## Installation


You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):


```

composer require ahp/minio-filesystem

```


If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:


```

composer require --dev ahp/minio-filesystem

```
